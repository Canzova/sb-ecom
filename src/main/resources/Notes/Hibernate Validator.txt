💡 What is @Valid?

@Valid is a Spring Boot annotation that tells Spring:

“Hey, before you use this object, first check if it’s valid according to the rules I defined.”

It comes from Hibernate Validator package/dependency. Just need to add it first in your pom.xml file from start.spring.io


Those “rules” are the validation annotations you put in your model class —
like @NotBlank, @NotNull, @Email, @Min, etc.

⚙️ Where do you use it?

You usually put @Valid before a @RequestBody in your controller.

Example 👇

@PostMapping("/categories")
public ResponseEntity<String> addCategory(@Valid @RequestBody Category category) {
    // This code runs only if the object passes all validation checks
    return ResponseEntity.ok("Category added successfully!");
}
