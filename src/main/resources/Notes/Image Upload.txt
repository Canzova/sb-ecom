            ➡️ It takes the uploaded image file from memory and writes it to your server’s disk at the location given by filePath.

            2️⃣ file.getInputStream()
            This gives you an InputStream to read the bytes of the uploaded file.

            Think of it like:
            “I’m opening a pipe to read the raw image data that the user sent.”
            You can use this stream to read the image’s contents one byte at a time.

            3️⃣ Paths.get(filePath)

            Paths.get(...) creates a Path object (from java.nio.file.Path) that represents a file or folder location in your system.

            For example:
            Paths.get("images/abc.jpg")
            represents → /your_project_root/images/abc.jpg

            So now you have a target destination on disk.

            4️⃣ Files.copy(...)

            This is a utility method from Java’s java.nio.file.Files class.
            It’s used to copy data from a source (like an InputStream or another file) to a target path.

            Its syntax:
            Files.copy(InputStream source, Path target, CopyOption... options)

            So in your code:

            source → file.getInputStream() (the uploaded image)
            target → Paths.get(filePath) (the place on your disk to save it)

            Hence:
            Files.copy(file.getInputStream(), Paths.get(filePath));

            literally means:
            "Take the uploaded image bytes from memory and write them into a file at this location on the server."
