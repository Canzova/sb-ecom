🧩 What is AppConfig in Java Spring?

In Spring Framework, AppConfig is a configuration class —
a Java class that tells Spring how to create and manage your beans (objects).


🏷️ @Configuration

---> Marks the class as a Spring configuration class.
---> Similar to a modern replacement for applicationContext.xml (old XML-based configuration).
---> Spring will scan this class and register all the beans you define with @Bean methods.

🏷️ @Bean

---> Marks a method that returns an object Spring should manage.
---> Spring will call that method and store the returned object in its Application Context (Spring’s “container”).

Then you can inject (use) those beans anywhere in your app with @Autowired or constructor injection.
