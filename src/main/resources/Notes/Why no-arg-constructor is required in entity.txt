💡 Why do we need a no-arg constructor in a JPA entity?

When you use Spring Boot + JPA (Hibernate),
JPA is the part that talks to your database — it saves and loads objects (entities).

Now, when JPA loads data from the database, it has to create an empty object first,
and then fill in the data (like setting id, name, etc.).

To do that, it needs a way to say:

“Hey, make me a new empty Category object!”

And the only way it can do that is by calling a constructor with no arguments.

That’s why every entity needs a no-argument constructor —
so JPA can create objects from database rows.
