🧠 1. DTO Purpose Recap

A DTO is simply a data container used to move data between layers —
like between the controller and the service.

You can think of it like a "safe copy" of your entity, showing only what the client needs.



🧱 2. So Why Do We Sometimes Add a “Response” Wrapper?

In many real-world APIs, you don’t just send raw data;
you also send metadata, like pagination info, total records, success status, etc.

Example:

{
  "content": [
    { "categoryId": 1, "categoryName": "Electronics" },
    { "categoryId": 2, "categoryName": "Fashion" }
  ],
  "pageNumber": 0,
  "pageSize": 10,
  "totalElements": 2,
  "totalPages": 1,
  "lastPage": true
}


That’s when we create a response wrapper class, e.g.:

public class CategoryResponse {
    private List<CategoryDTO> content;
    private int pageNumber;
    private int pageSize;
    private long totalElements;
    private int totalPages;
    private boolean lastPage;
}
